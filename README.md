# Space Marine Hash Algorithm
Simple implementation of Space Marine 64-bit hashing algorithm discovered by Copernicus.
## Usage
Requires .Net 6

Feed it with string to hash in cmd line args. The result will be returned in stdout.

Typically used for hashing strings to build BOD files and for type names in OPPC.

Note from Copernicus: 
> "Convert strings to lower case before hashing to get correct results. In the grim dark future of the 41st millennium, there is only lower-case.
